# Task

Complete the implementation in `flatten-array.ts`.

# Instructions

Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.

For example:

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]

# Confirmation

To confirm that your solution is correct, run the tests with `yarn test`.
You might need to install the dependencies first with `yarn install`.
